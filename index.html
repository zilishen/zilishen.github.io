								<b>Bio: </b> Zili was born in Beijing, China and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2019 with two majors, physics and astronomy. 
								She completed an honors thesis titled “Falsifiability of the Multiverse Theory” under the mentorship of Prof. Volker Bromm. 
								At UT, she studied the star formation history of dwarf galaxies with her research advisor Dr. Kristen McQuinn. Zili continued to study galaxies at Yale,
								now focusing on the enigmatic "Dark-matter-free" galaxies NGC1052-DF2 and DF4. Particularly, she
								hopes to find clues of how these galaxies formed and evolved from their unusual population of globular clusters. 
								When she is not studying or stargazing, she spends her time skiing, baking, visiting museums, and reading about philosophy.
