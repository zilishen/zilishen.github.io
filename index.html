								<!-- <b>Bio: </b>  -->
								Zili is an aspiring AI safety researcher focusing on evaluations. She is currently exploring alignment issues with LLM agents carrying out long-horizon tasks.  She graduated from Yale in 2025 with a Ph.D. in astrophysics. For her thesis project, she led the science analysis of the Dragonfly Ultrawide Survey and built a custom pipeline on AWS. 
								Apart from research, she writes about science. She published articles on Astrobites and worked at the Yale Graduate Writing Lab as a writing consultant.

								A project funded by the <a href="https://algoverseairesearch.org/ai-safety-fellowship" target="_blank">Algoverse AI Safety Fellowship</a>. 
								LLM agents are being deployed to carry out tasks on behalf of their users. Some of those tasks involve many steps and a large context. During this process, are agents able to retain their alignment training, remember the original goal, and deal with potential changes in the environment that they were not trained on?
